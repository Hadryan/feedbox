Well, lucky for you, XDA Forum Member <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5312715">llcdraco</a> does as well, and he has just your fix with Space TD.</p>
<p>As its name implies, Space TD is a Turret/Tower Defense game, in which your sole responsibility is to defend your planet against a fleet of angry alien invaders. To do this, you place automated turrets below the would-be invaders, in hopes that they have what it takes to prevent the onslaught.</p>
<p>Due to the attackers coming from overhead, it differs from traditional TD-style games in that there is no set track for the assailants to come through. Rather, they fly towards your planet in as efficient of a flight path as they can. But armed with several types of turrets and a wonderful retro-inspired soundtrack, you are more than able to give them a run for their money.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to give this a shot? Head over to the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2326720">game thread</a> to defend your base!</p>

With a Goliath 6.4 inch screen as its main selling point, your eyes may have been drawn to its new user interface and what not, especially its new launcher, widgets, and wallpapers. Good thing for you folks, as XDA Recognized Themer <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=1356962">ThilinaC</a> brings a complete transformation pack for your device featuring these new goodies.</p>
<p>ThilinaC has managed to port the new launcher and widgets of the Xperia Z Ultra, with a whole bunch of additional features not native to the original versions. Most notably, support for multiple resolutions means you don&#8217;t need a phablet to enjoy these ports. And aside from the default 6&#215;4 app drawer, custom dimensions have also been made available, such as 7&#215;5 for xhdpi devices, 5&#215;4 and 4&#215;4 for hdpi, and 4&#215;4 for mdpi. The rest of the feature are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">New Xperia Z Ultra widgets</span></li>
<li>Auto rotation</li>
<li>Tablet support</li>
<li>Support for up to 7 home screens</li>
</ul>
<p>Installation is straight forward and pretty much the same for both Xperia and non-Xperia devices, requiring you to download the base zip files of the launcher and widgets ports and simply flashing them through a custom recovery such as CWM or TWRP. However, the latter does require an additional reboot in between the installation of the two base zip files. If there&#8217;s an aspect of the launcher you&#8217;re not a fan of (such as the dimensions of the app drawer) or if you don&#8217;t like the bar of the home dock, ThilinaC has conveniently provided various modification zip files with different options.</p>
<p>It must be stated that the ports are compatible only with devices running Android version 4.2.2 as of now, and root access is a must. So if you would like to learn more or give this a go, be sure to head over to the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2102397" target="_blank">original thread</a> for more information and downloads.</p>

Let&#8217;s 8-Bit Art by XDA Forum Member <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4933124">CraZyDecigames</a> is a little different in that respect.</p>
<p>The application, as the name suggests, primarily serves the purpose of allowing artists, animators, and game designers to create 8-bit style raster images and animations. The applications supports PNG, JPG, BMP, and GIF formats, and boasts a fairly impressive feature list for an application that&#8217;<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">s</span> still in its beta stage. Some of the <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">applications</span> key features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">9 configurable drawing <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">tool</span></span></li>
<li>32 bit ARGB <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">pallete</span></li>
<li><span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_noSuggestion GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">Customisable</span> <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">colour</span>/<span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_correct">pallete</span> manager</li>
<li>Ability to work with small images at high zoom without interpolation</li>
<li>Auto save and full resume when reopening application</li>
<li>Save animations  to sprite set in PNG format</li>
<li>Built in file manager</li>
<li>Many, many more&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a need to create images such as this, Let&#8217;s 8-Bit Art is well worth a look. As mentioned above, the application is still currently in the <span class="GINGER_SOFATWARE_spelling">beta stage, and unfortunately lacks the ability to save and reopen projects until the final version.  If you&#8217;d like to check this out and help contribute to the beta test, check out the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2355697">application thread</a>.</span></p>

<p>As hinted previously, the game&#8217;s concept is very much like a fusion of lawn bowls and air hockey, as you&#8217;re presented with six circles (or balls) of differing sizes and you must try to flick (or bowl)  into the opposition&#8217;s zone. Unlike a lot of games out there, the color scheme in Flicky Circles has an integral role in the game play. With one color designated for you and your opponent, your circles&#8217; color corresponds with the opposition&#8217;s zone, where you must aim for. It&#8217;s not as easy as it seems, because the game also has white colored end zones, where if you managed to flick a little too hard or too soft, your circle will respectively disappear from the game, or be returned to your lineup of remaining circles.</p>
<p>You may flick your circles towards those of your opposition as a rebound object, or to simply knock them back to the other side. There&#8217;s also a lock feature, which when activated, will secure your circles in their current positions for one turn. You can either play against the computer, or you can have a friend to play with as your opponent. And once you&#8217;ve won against them, you can proclaim the glorious victory by sharing the score on Facebook.</p>
<p>Flicky Circles can be downloaded for free from the Play store, and will support any device running Android version 2.3 or newer, and with any screen resolution between HVGA and 1080p. So if this has stirred your curiosity, be sure to check out the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=43325344#post43325344" target="_blank">original thread</a> for more information.</p>

Although the update includes some exciting new features, which are described in an earlier posted <a title="Review of the New Google Maps" href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/review-of-the-new-google-maps/" target="_blank">article</a>, it also lacked a few useful features that were in previous versions. This of course left some of the Android community with negative feedback and criticism. In response to those complaints, Google posted a <a title="Google announces update to update" href="https://plus.google.com/+GoogleMaps/posts/4Cm8CfXz2qS" target="_blank">public statement</a> on its G+ account at approximately 1 a.m. PST, July 11.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through its G+ post, Google acknowledge user complaints concerning the lack of easy access to offline maps.  While the update did include a feature to cache maps by typing in &#8220;ok maps&#8221; in the search bar, users were left unsatisfied. In addition to this &#8220;hidden&#8221; feature, Google promised that offline maps were simply disabled for the time being and would return in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Due to the negative response,  Google quickened up the pace of this &#8220;future update&#8221; and put its engineering team in overdrive. The company said they have been working around the clock in order to make this feature available once again. A &#8220;Make this map area available offline&#8221; card has been implemented below the search box as a way to make offline mapping easier to access. For those who prefer typing, the &#8220;ok maps&#8221; command still works. The update also answers the question &#8220;where&#8217;s Latitude,&#8221; by clicking the link at the bottom of the side menu. Doing so provides more information about what is in store for location sharing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep an eye on your notification bar because the new update to the update will be rolling out globally starting today.</p>

These tend to make <a href="https://heml.is" target="_blank">bold promises of being secure, protecting users from surveillance, and being better than equivalent services</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 3 notable personalities in the web-o-sphere lost much credibility in my (and anyone interested in security&#8217;s) view. Why? For using pseudo-security, and trying to market it as security. They clearly do not have a strong background in cryptography or security theory, and appear out to make money, rather than to create a well-designed and well-architected, resilient and decentralised service. And I&#8217;m not against someone making a commercial service, but hey, at least design it well, and make it open source.</p>
<p>Open source doesn&#8217;t prevent being a commercial success. Take a look at, say, Android, or RedHat Linux, or SUSE, or indeed any open source project with a company behind it that doesn&#8217;t turn a loss (and hey, a company that runs at a loss won&#8217;t last long).</p>
<p>Without further ado, let&#8217;s just take a look at what they say about their service.</p>
<p>From their own FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Will it be Open Source?</em></strong><br />
<strong> We have all intentions of opening up the source as much as possible for scrutiny and help! What we really want people to understand however, is that Open Source in itself does not guarantee any privacy or safety. It sure helps with transparency, but technology by itself is not enough. The fundamental benefits of Heml.is will be the app together with our infrastructure, which is what really makes the system interesting and secure.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>While it is true that being open source alone is not a guarantee of security, they want to open the source, &#8220;as much as possible&#8221;. Yet they are intent on offering a closed platform. From history, lessons have been learned about poor security, such as <a href="http://tobtu.com/decryptocat.php">Cryptocat</a>, which is open-source, and has had many security holes. Would these holes (which are critical to the security of the service) have been found if it was not open source? Arguably not, as they arose in review of the source code.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Is it really secure?</em></strong><br />
<strong> Yes and no. Nothing is ever 100% secure. There will not be any way for someone without access to your phone to read anything, but with access to your phone they can of course read the messages. Just as they can use any other app you have installed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests the decryption keys are stored unprotected on the device, meaning a rooted device permits trivial key retrieval. This can easily be avoided by encrypting the key with a strong, password-derived key. Every rooted user should be aware of this. But likely won&#8217;t, as the makers appear unwilling to suggest downsides of the system.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Your server only?<br />
</em>Yes! The way to make the system secure is that we can control the infrastructure. Distributing to other servers makes it impossible to give any guarantees about the security. We’ll have audits from trusted third parties on our platforms regularly, in cooperation with our community.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>How is this ANY better than iMessage, or any other large-corporation, closed-source rival? If they control the infrastructure, and one cannot freely review the source code running on it, this is just as bad as <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/06/can-apple-read-your-imessages.html">iMessage, which is simply not secure</a>. They mention third party audits in cooperation with the community, but what community will there be, when the software is closed source, and entirely centralized?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Will you provide an API and/or allow third party clients?</em></strong><br />
<strong> At this point we don’t see how that would be possible without compromising the security, so for now the answer is no.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>In security, the mantra is &#8220;trust nothing&#8221;. In particular, it is NEVER safe to trust the end user&#8217;s device, or client software. The answer above says that they, the experts, cannot see a way to permit an API or third party clients, without compromising security. As everyone familiar with XDA knows, it is trivially easy to modify apps and their underlying code, as is seen with tools like smali and apktool, as well as the Xposed Framework.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>It is clear that this Heml.is system is placing far too much trust in the clients in this system. While alternative systems are trusting nobody but themselves (for example, Bitcoin), this is a step backwards, towards the dependent situation where users are forced to trust a closed network, over which they have no input. This closed network can only run on the servers of the service provider.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Does Heml.is save every message on a server?</em></strong><br />
<strong> Messages will only be stored on our end until they have been delivered to the recipient. We might add support for optional expiry times to messages, in which case messages would be stored until they had been delivered or they expire. Whichever comes first.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Frankly, this answer actually made me laugh out loud, and get many a strange look. This is the kind of answer that public relations (PR) people dream of. The answer here is &#8220;yes&#8221;, and the people behind Heml.is even admit it. But they fail to recognize that with an untrusted central server, you are forced to go simply on THEIR WORD that they actually do remove these messages. What makes you certain they do remove them? And that they always will? Do you trust the NSA to remove what they store about you? Do you trust iMessage to? Why should you trust Heml.is to?</p>
<p>I honestly cannot understand why they have brought this kind of product to the public at this stage; they have proposed nothing in any way better than ANY other service on the market. There is as much guaranteed security in this system as there is in standing on a pedestal in a crowded city with a megaphone and shouting your correspondence to the world. This is a real shame, as I really hoped that Heml.is would be different. I thought more from its developers, who have reputations for being sensible and privacy/security conscious.</p>
<p>What is on offer here is a closed-box security system. Statistically speaking, any project of this magnitude will have at least 1 major flaw in its cryptographic implementation. And I can already predict that flaw, having no access to the software, or indeed any information beyond that available to us all from their website. So I will make that prediction now, and in public. This system will, in my professional opinion, rely on trusting their centralized server for the identification and authentication of users to each other. Meaning, if the central server is compromised, or the operators are forced through duress, they would be able to modify the server so a request for Bob&#8217;s public key would return a public key under the control of the attacker. The only way to alleviate this is to have an entirely open and distributed, decentralized back-end, which never trusts a client not to lie, and a client that never trusts the server.</p>
<p>It is not currently possible to achieve perfect security in this sense (of being assured the key you receive is from the person it claims to be), short of in-person verification of key fingerprints. But it is possible to at least not rely on a centralized server to be trustworthy, when that server is not able to be inspected by yourself, and independently run. This was a major opportunity for a totally distributed network facilitating free and secure private communications, which has been spoiled through a lack of experience by those designing it, with regard to security.</p>
<p>I see no way that even the proposal can withstand any kind of scrutiny from those in the security field such as myself. I would love for the guys behind it to get in touch, and see if they are willing to address some of these issues. Perhaps it&#8217;s all a big set of misunderstandings, but from the wording here, this system is wholly insecure, and relies entirely upon their &#8220;service in the middle&#8221; to honestly relay keys to users. And if they&#8217;re going for &#8220;all out convenience&#8221;, that will be the easiest way to go. But there are plenty of changes they can make to improve this system, and if they are willing to discuss this, I am more than happy to make a few suggestions that would eliminate the issues with their central server, and &#8220;no third party clients&#8221; (which effectively means they wouldn&#8217;t properly open-source the resulting application).</p>
<p><strong>Peter, Leif or Linus, drop me an email (pulser _at_ xda-developers.com) and we can have a constructive chat about this, </strong>and if you want to make a response here, add one. As it stands though, this whole project comes across as an exercise to produce money from the &#8220;masses&#8221; for the promise of secure communications. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. But at least make it use proper, well-designed, and robust security principles, which will stand up to users making use of third party clients, or being able to ensure they are not placing any trust in your server for key distribution. If you rely on trusting the user&#8217;s client to behave, or on your server to never be compromised (and your staff never placed under legal or physical threats), then one day, the walls will crumble down. And it&#8217;s all achievable, while being fully open-source, open-standard, and open-platform.</p>

<p>As with its spiritual predecessor by fiinix, GoodDayToDie&#8217;s app enumerates files visible to the sandbox, and it also allows users to download them. Getting started is fairly simple. All you have to do is sideload the app, connect to LAN, run the application, and point the client web browser (on the same LAN) to the phone&#8217;s internal IP address. Once in the index page, enter your desired path into the text box and click Get Files to access the file list. After you have the file list, click any file to download it.</p>
<p>The app is still under heavy development, and as you would expect, there are a few quirks that users must deal with if they want to play with this as it&#8217;s being developed. For instance, there is currently no way to tell the difference between a file and a folder in the list view. Also, occasional errors and exceptions are to be expected while GoodDayToDie finishes adding polish. However, for those who can&#8217;t wait and wish to give this a try, there is no reason why not.</p>
<p>Want to know the best part? GoodDayToDie has made this fully open source, with the sources available in the thread OP. Head over to the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2355034">original thread</a> to get started.</p>

The disappointment lied mainly in the fact that Google failed to release the highly anticipated Android update, Key Lime Pie.  Instead, the annual developers conference, which was held the week of May 15, focused on developer tools and a rebuild of Google Maps. The "new Google Maps," as the San Jose based company calls it, is a major update which integrates Google Earth to create three-dimensional tours of user surroundings. According to Google, the application highlights the things that matter most to you, wherever you go and whatever you are doing.

On July 10, two months after Google's announcement of the exciting new update, the company finally introduced the mapping application for Android smartphones and tablets. Google Maps v7.0.0 is gradually rolling out global updates to Android 4.0.3+ devices through the Google Play store, and soon  through the App Store for iOS products. For those of you who cannot wait for the update, leaked apk's are already being seen in the wild. Updates are specific to android versions, so if you can't wait for it to be officially rolled to your device, make sure you are following the correct download.  For quick access to Android 4.1+ updates, see Android Police compiled list of mirrors.]]></description>

The disappointment was mainly in the fact that Google failed to release the highly anticipated Android update, Key Lime Pie.  Instead, the annual developers conference, which was held the week of May 15, focused on developer tools and a rebuild of Google Maps. The &#8220;new Google Maps,&#8221; as the Mountain View company calls it, is a major update that integrates Google Earth to create three-dimensional tours of user surroundings. <a title="Explore the new Google Maps" href="http://www.google.com/maps/about/explore/" target="_blank">According to Google</a>, the application highlights the things that matter most to you, wherever you go and whatever you are doing.</p>
<p>On July 10, two months after Google&#8217;s announcement of the exciting new update, the company finally introduced the mapping application for Android smartphones and tablets. Google Maps v7.0.0 is gradually rolling out global updates to Android 4.0.3+ devices through the Google Play store, and soon  through the App Store for iOS devices. For those of you who cannot wait for the update, leaked APKs are already being seen in the wild. Updates are specific to Android versions, so if you can&#8217;t wait for it to be officially rolled to your device, make sure you are following the correct download.  For quick access to Android 4.1+ updates, see Android Police&#8217;s compiled list of <a title="Android Police Mirrors" href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/07/09/google-maps-for-android-gets-updated-with-promised-interface-refresh-functionality-enhancements/" target="_blank">mirrors</a>.</p>
<p>As a Nexus 4 user, I followed <a title="Google Maps APK" href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=43434859#post43434859" target="_blank">this thread</a> created by XDA Senior Member <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2657263">gear.h34d.2012</a>, during my test drive (get it? &#8220;test drive,&#8221; &#8220;Google Maps,&#8221; bahahaha) of the app. Unfortunately, the original link is unavailable do to increased traffic on his Dropbox account. However, a <a href="http://d-h.st/Lo4">mirror was posted</a> directing traffic to grab the file at Dev-Host.</p>
<p>Google has continued with the simplistic and modern Holo user interface aesthetic seen in the rest of its recent app updates, but has deviated a bit in certain design choices. Keeping in form with the rest of the Gapps package, they have also replaced the old fashioned drop down menu with a hidden swipe-to-access gestures. Unfortunately, the drop down menu isn&#8217;t the only thing missing from this update. Latitude and check-ins, offline mode , and My Maps have also been removed.  If you are <em>steering</em> clear of the update for this reason, you will only have until August 9 before Latitude and check-ins are retired for good. In the meantime, those who want to continue to stalk their friends and family can do so via the location sharing and check-in features on  G+.</p>
<p>For those of you who tend to travel in low-signal areas and require offline maps, you still have the option to cache portions of your map by zooming into the map and typing &#8220;OK Maps&#8221; into the search box. Lastly, although My Maps is not available in this release, it will return in future versions of the app. Google recommended using <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2013/03/create-collaborate-and-share-advanced.html" target="_BLANK">Maps Engine Lite</a> on desktop for those who absolutely cannot live without custom maps.</p>
<p>So what exactly does the new Google Maps bring to the table? For one thing, the entire map is interactive. Clicking on any of the nearby location marks will give you instant reviews, business information, street view pictures, and a navigation option that displays how long it will take to arrive at that destination. You can also save locations and share them right from the main maps screen. These options are not new by any means, but the new design shaves a few steps in the process.</p>
<p>Navigation also became a lot simpler with quick access to recent locations, and the ability to easily choose whether you are traveling by car, bus, bicycle, foot, or boat (okay maybe not by boat, but the other four options should get you where you need to be). One thing I found handy is the ability to easily choose to navigate from either your current location or a completely different starting point.</p>
<p>For those of you who like to explore, Google has made it possible to quickly uncover local favorites, including places to eat, shop, play, and more.  And for those who are unable to find the &#8220;Explore&#8221; option, it seems to be location-based and may not be available if you live in a less populated area. Try searching for the closest city near you, such as Sacramento, CA, and then check to see if  &#8221;Explore&#8221; appears.  With the built in five-star rating and reviews system, you can easily decide the places that best fit your needs. Who really needs a Chamber of Commerce when you have Google Maps and detailed reviews?</p>
<p>Lastly, the latest Google Maps will not only help get you to your destination efficiently, it will also get you their as quickly as possible by &#8220;outsmarting traffic jams,&#8221; as the company puts it. Through dynamic rerouting and live incident reporting, Google Maps will help get you to your destination on time, and without delay.</p>
